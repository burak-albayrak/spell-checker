# spell-checker
This project is a simple spell checker implemented in Java using a Ternary Search Tree (TST) for efficient storage and retrieval of dictionary words. The program reads a dictionary file and allows the user to input words to check their spelling. If the word is misspelled, it suggests alternatives based on the given prefix.
